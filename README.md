## Getting Started

#### Basic usage

```tsx

export const AudioRecorder: React.FC<AudioRecorderProps> = () => {
  const { start, stop, pause, resume } = useAudioRecorder({
    onStart: () => {
      console.log('Recording started.');
    },
    onStop: (_e, chunks) => {
      const blob = new Blob(chunks, { type: chunks[0].type });
      const file = new File([blob], 'sampleFile.webm', {
        type: chunks[0].type,
      });
      console.log(file);
    },
  });

  return (
    <div>
